Initializing
Create a new client for use in the browser.

You can initialize a new Supabase client using the createClient() method.

The Supabase client is your entrypoint to the rest of the Supabase functionality and is the easiest way to interact with everything we offer within the Supabase ecosystem.
Parameters

supabaseUrl
REQUIRED
string
The unique Supabase URL which is supplied when you create a new project in your project dashboard.
supabaseKey
REQUIRED
string
The unique Supabase Key which is supplied when you create a new project in your project dashboard.

const supabase = createClient('https://xyzcompany.supabase.co', 'public-anon-key')

TypeScript support
supabase-js has TypeScript support for type inference, autocompletion, type-safe queries, and more.

With TypeScript, supabase-js detects things like not null constraints and generated columns. Nullable columns are typed as T | null when you select the column. Generated columns will show a type error when you insert to it.

supabase-js also detects relationships between tables. A referenced table with one-to-many relationship is typed as T[]. Likewise, a referenced table with many-to-one relationship is typed as T | null.

Generating TypeScript Types#

You can use the Supabase CLI to generate the types. You can also generate the types from the dashboard.

Terminal

supabase gen types typescript --project-id abcdefghijklmnopqrst > database.types.ts
These types are generated from your database schema. Given a table public.movies, the generated types will look like:

create table public.movies (
  id bigint generated always as identity primary key,
  name text not null,
  data jsonb null
);

./database.types.ts

export type Json = string | number | boolean | null | { [key: string]: Json | undefined } | Json[]

export interface Database {
  public: {
    Tables: {
      movies: {
        Row: {               // the data expected from .select()
          id: number
          name: string
          data: Json | null
        }
        Insert: {            // the data to be passed to .insert()
          id?: never         // generated columns must not be supplied
          name: string       // `not null` columns with no default must be supplied
          data?: Json | null // nullable columns can be omitted
        }
        Update: {            // the data to be passed to .update()
          id?: never
          name?: string      // `not null` columns are optional on .update()
          data?: Json | null
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
Using TypeScript type definitions#

You can supply the type definitions to supabase-js like so:

./index.tsx

import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'
import { Database } from './database.types'

const supabase = createClient<Database>(
  process.env.SUPABASE_URL,
  process.env.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
)
Helper types for Tables and Joins#

You can use the following helper types to make the generated TypeScript types easier to use.

Sometimes the generated types are not what you expect. For example, a view's column may show up as nullable when you expect it to be not null. Using type-fest, you can override the types like so:

./database-generated.types.ts

export type Json = // ...

export interface Database {
  // ...
}
./database.types.ts

import { MergeDeep } from 'type-fest'
import { Database as DatabaseGenerated } from './database-generated.types'
export { Json } from './database-generated.types'

// Override the type for a specific column in a view:
export type Database = MergeDeep<
  DatabaseGenerated,
  {
    public: {
      Views: {
        movies_view: {
          Row: {
            // id is a primary key in public.movies, so it must be `not null`
            id: number
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
>
You can also override the type of an individual successful response if needed:

const { data } = await supabase.from('countries').select().returns<MyType>()

The generated types provide shorthands for accessing tables and enums.

./index.ts

import { Database, Tables, Enums } from "./database.types.ts";

// Before üòï
let movie: Database['public']['Tables']['movies']['Row'] = // ...

// After üòç
let movie: Tables<'movies'>
Response types for complex queries#

supabase-js always returns a data object (for success), and an error object (for unsuccessful requests).

These helper types provide the result types from any query, including nested types for database joins.

Given the following schema with a relation between cities and countries, we can get the nested CountriesWithCities type:

create table countries (
  "id" serial primary key,
  "name" text
);

create table cities (
  "id" serial primary key,
  "name" text,
  "country_id" int references "countries"
);

import { QueryResult, QueryData, QueryError } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const countriesWithCitiesQuery = supabase
  .from("countries")
  .select(`
    id,
    name,
    cities (
      id,
      name
    )
  `);
type CountriesWithCities = QueryData<typeof countriesWithCitiesQuery>;

const { data, error } = await countriesWithCitiesQuery;
if (error) throw error;
const countriesWithCities: CountriesWithCities = data;

Fetch data
Perform a SELECT query on the table or view.

By default, Supabase projects return a maximum of 1,000 rows. This setting can be changed in your project's API settings. It's recommended that you keep it low to limit the payload size of accidental or malicious requests. You can use range() queries to paginate through your data.
select() can be combined with Filters
select() can be combined with Modifiers
apikey is a reserved keyword if you're using the Supabase Platform and should be avoided as a column name.

Upsert data
Perform an UPSERT on the table or view. Depending on the column(s) passed to onConflict, .upsert() allows you to perform the equivalent of .insert() if a row with the corresponding onConflict columns doesn't exist, or if it does exist, perform an alternative action depending on ignoreDuplicates.

Primary keys must be included in values to use upsert.

Data source
Response
Delete data
Perform a DELETE on the table or view.

delete() should always be combined with filters to target the item(s) you wish to delete.
If you use delete() with filters and you have RLS enabled, only rows visible through SELECT policies are deleted. Note that by default no rows are visible, so you need at least one SELECT/ALL policy that makes the rows visible.
When using delete().in(), specify an array of values to target multiple rows with a single query. This is particularly useful for batch deleting entries that share common criteria, such as deleting users by their IDs. Ensure that the array you provide accurately represents all records you intend to delete to avoid unintended data removal.

Data source
Response
Using modifiers
Filters work on the row level‚Äîthey allow you to return rows that only match certain conditions without changing the shape of the rows. Modifiers are everything that don't fit that definition‚Äîallowing you to change the format of the response (e.g., returning a CSV string).

Modifiers must be specified after filters. Some modifiers only apply for queries that return rows (e.g., select() or rpc() on a function that returns a table response).
Return data after inserting
Perform a SELECT on the query result.
Parameters

REALTIME:

Subscribe to channel
Creates an event handler that listens to changes.

By default, Broadcast and Presence are enabled for all projects.
By default, listening to database changes is disabled for new projects due to database performance and security concerns. You can turn it on by managing Realtime's replication.
You can receive the "previous" data for updates and deletes by setting the table's REPLICA IDENTITY to FULL (e.g., ALTER TABLE your_table REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;).
Row level security is not applied to delete statements. When RLS is enabled and replica identity is set to full, only the primary key is sent to clients.

Unsubscribe from a channel
Unsubscribes and removes Realtime channel from Realtime client.

Removing a channel is a great way to maintain the performance of your project's Realtime service as well as your database if you're listening to Postgres changes. Supabase will automatically handle cleanup 30 seconds after a client is disconnected, but unused channels may cause degradation as more clients are simultaneously subscribed.
